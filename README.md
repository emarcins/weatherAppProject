# WeatherAppProject üå¶Ô∏è
Small app which can show you the actual weather üå§Ô∏è

# Language and Tools
There's a smart and simply code, which I create (with Matuesz Maj developer help) in pure Javascript. 
</br>
The code using the API of the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/current) and it shows a currently weather in city which you can input.
The personal API key remain hide because of secure settings!

# Code ‚å®Ô∏è
In this App I'm choose Axios beacuse I wanted to learning how to apply in async code!
And also as I wrote above I'm using the one of the weather API to improve my skills.

# How to use? 
The App using API to show you currently weather, tempreture (in Celsius degree) and percent of humidity. 
</br>
All you can do is put the name of the city which you can try in input and click "Check" or just hit the Enter on your keyboard.
If the name of the city doesn't exist you should be inform and try on more time!
